# Island Adventures

### A modification for Don't Starve Together

The aim of this mod is to bring the content from the Don't Starve DLC "Shipwrecked" to Don't Starve Together, also adapting and tuning it to suit multiplayer better. All of the content is based on Shipwrecked, there are no completely new features included.

>Donâ€™t let the tropical breeze lull you into a false sense of security - the world might be different, but it is still equal parts unforgiving and uncompromising. You will quickly find these islands are full to the brim with things that want to kill you.

Unpack the ZIP file in your DST mod folder (usually " C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Don't Starve Together\mods"). If you can't find your DST folder, use Steam to "browse local files".
Lastly, enable the mod when starting a server. Clients will automatically enable the mod when joining an IA server.

This mod requires the Gem Core API: https://gitlab.com/DSTAPIS/GemCore/wikis/Home

This mod requires the "Island Adventures - Sound" addon. This is a separate mod solely due to an upload limit on Steam Workshop preventing us from packing it all in one mod. Also, it's easier to update this way. Unlike the Steam version, the GitLab version doesn't force-require the Sound addon from Steam Workshop.

Please remember that the GitLab version may be unstable.
